            I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in information systems technology from
            United States International University-Africa and have more than 2
            years of experience as a front-end developer. I have advanced
            knowledge of React and Node.js, as well as the ability to work
            independently and solve problems creatively.

            I've worked on several projects, including a clothing e-commerce
            website where users can buy clothes; a cryptocurrency tracker where
            users can keep track of their cryptocurrencies; and a YouTube clone
            where users can watch YouTube videos. These projects have helped me
            improve my programming skills immensely.
